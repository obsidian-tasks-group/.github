## Hi there 👋

This is the GitHub organisation for maintaining and improving the [Obsidian Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks).

It's a top 10 plugin, and is the 🏆 winner of the [2022 Obsidian Plugin Gem of the Year](https://obsidian.md/blog/2022-goty-winners/).

Originally written by Martin Schenck (@schemar), it's now maintained by Clare Macrae (@claremacrae).

### Donations

The Tasks plugin is completely free to use, and very willingly developed and supported by Clare Macrae since May 2022.

If you have particularly been helped by the Tasks plugin and wish to support it, please see the following link.

Donations will go towards computing costs and licenses for development tools used for productivity.

Thank you 🙏.
